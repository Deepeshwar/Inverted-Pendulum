# Inverted-Pendulum is control system based project in which i have don its "MATHEMATICAL MODELLING AND CONTROLLER DESIGN FOR INVERTED PENDULUM".
So here we are dealing with the stabilization of the inverted pendulum which is a classical control problem. For bringing the inb=verted pendulum system from unstable to stable state, we design the possible control system for it.
The practical results has been obtained from the hardware setup of the inverted pendulum system using Arduino mega controller and the PID controller used for control the angular position in upward direction for hardware setup.
